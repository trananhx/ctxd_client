# Source Summaries

One page per ingested source (GDD chapter, meeting note, playtest report, reference deck). Each summary captures: provenance, a short abstract, key claims (link to [[claims]]), and which wiki pages were created/updated from it.

## Page filename

`<source-slug>.md` — kebab-case from the source's title or filename.

## Page template

```markdown
---
title: <Source title>
category: sources
tags: []
source_path: raw/gdd/<file>     # source-summary pages use this instead of the standard `sources:` list (they describe exactly one source)
source_type: gdd | spec | meeting | playtest | reference | technical
date: YYYY-MM-DD                # date OF the source, not ingest date
authors: [optional]
created: YYYY-MM-DD              # ingest date (same as `ingested` below)
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
